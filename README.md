# IMP spatiotemporal tutorial
NOTE: This tutorial is still in progress of being completed. Please do not use yet. In the meantime, see https://github.com/salilab/imp/tree/develop/modules/spatiotemporal/examples/toy for a worked demonstration of the spatiotemporal module

Tutorial for computing spatiotemporal integrative models in IMP. For more information please check out the related publications:
* Latham et al. in preparation. (methods paper)
* Latham et al. in preparation. (tutorial paper)

### This tutorial explores scripts that:
* Generates snapshot models at various timepoints along a dynamic process
* Connects models at neighboring time points to produce a set of trajectory models of the process of interest
* Score and assess these trajectory models to evaluate their accuracy and precision

### Running the Tutorial
See [the IMP website](https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/spatiotemporal/) for the tutorial text.
Finally, please note that the tutorial is based on synthetically generated data, and is not meant to be indicative of the true assembly process of this protein complex.
