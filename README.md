# IMP spatiotemporal tutorial

Tutorial for computing spatiotemporal integrative models in IMP. For more information please check out the related publications:
* Latham bioRxiv, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.606842.
* Latham et al. in preparation. (tutorial paper)

### This tutorial explores scripts that:
* Generates snapshot models at various timepoints along a dynamic process
* Connects models at neighboring time points to produce a set of trajectory models of the process of interest
* Score and assess these trajectory models to evaluate their accuracy and precision

### Running the Tutorial
See [the IMP website](https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/spatiotemporal/) for the tutorial text.
A worked example (modeling) and an empty example with the necessary scripts and data for the user to run (modeling_empty) are provided.
Finally, please note that the tutorial is based on synthetically generated data, and is not meant to be indicative of the true assembly process of this protein complex.
