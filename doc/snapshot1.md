Snapshot modeling steps 2-4: representation, scoring, and search process {#snapshot1}
====================================

Here, we describe how to build models of static snapshots using IMP. We note that this process is similar to previous tutorials (https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/actin/ and https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/rnapolii_stalk/).

Describe the difference between the two scripts.

# Modeling one snapshot

## Representing the model

Topology file

Representation of EM data

## Scoring the model

Restraints:
Connectivity
Excluded volume
Cross-linking
EM restraint

## Searching for good scoring models

Sampling

Describe sampling output

# Generalizing modeling to all snapshots

Selection of snapshots to model

Run loop above for all snapshots
