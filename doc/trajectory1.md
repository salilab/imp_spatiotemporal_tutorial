Trajectory modeling steps 2-4: representation, scoring, and search process {#trajectory1}
====================================

Now, we have snapshot models for various intermediate states along our process of interest. In this step, we will combine these snapshot models to produce trajectories.

# Representing the model

# Scoring the model

# Searching for good scoring models
