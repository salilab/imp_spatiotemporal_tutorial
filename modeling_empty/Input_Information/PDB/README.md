### This directory contains PDB structures for the spatiotemporal modeling tutorial.

#### There are 2 pdb files in this directory:
1. 3rpg_original.pdb - the original PDB file of the Bmi1/Ring1b-UbcH5c complex.
2. 3rpg.pdb - the PDB of the Bmi1/Ring1b-UbcH5c complex with non-protein atoms removed. This is the starting configuration used in our modeling.
